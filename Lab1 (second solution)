            "TL;DR: Today, one can't escape Distributed Systems. They are all around us---from the datacenters and clouds we use directly or indirectly every day; to smart devices, smart homes, and smart buildings/cities; to machine learning running inside AI systems online and in the physical world. Yet many common concepts, algorithms, and systems design and implementation techniques, pervade and permeate through many of these seemingly disparate types of distributed systems. Prof. Indranil Gupta (Indy) does research and teaching on these topics. His research is driven by a love of working on real problems (very often motivated by industry), devising solutions with intellectual depth, and then implementing and evaluating them with real testbeds and systems. He also collaborates with industry production teams. His group is one of the most diverse in the CS department. He teaches the world's largest (online) class on distributed systems, apart from regular on-campus teaching. Sometimes he improvises music to teach Computer Science.In Detail:Prof. Indranil Gupta (Indy) is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Indy leads the Distributed Protocols Research Group in the CS Department at UIUC. He is interested in research on distributed systems, with specific focus on large-scale distributed systems such as datacenters. cloud computing systems, IoT, Distributed Machine Learning, etc.  Indranil Gupta is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and IEEE Senior Member. Indranil is recipient of the the NSF CAREER award in 2005, the Junior Xerox Award for Faculty Research in 2008, the CAS/Beckman Fellowship in 2009, and the Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Faculty Fellowship in 2010. He has won Best Paper Awards at IEEE IC2E 2018, IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2017, IEEE IC2E 2016, IEEE ICAC 2015 and BigMine 2012. Indranil has received teaching recognition in the UIUC \"List of Teachers ranked as Excellent\" multiple times since 2003. He served as General Chair of ACM PODC 2007; PC co-chair at multiple conferences over the years (Usenix HotCloud 2018, IEEE IC2E 2017, LADIS 2017, IEEE ICCAC 2016, ACM DeMiST 2016, IEEE P2P 2014, ACM/IFIP/Usenix Middleware 2010, IEEE SASO 2010 and StoDiS 2005). He is on the editorial board for both ACM TAAS (Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems) and IEEE TCC (Transactions on Cloud Computing). Previously, Indranil received his PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University in 2004. He has worked at Google (2011-12), IBM Research (T.J. Watson) and Microsoft Research (Cambridge, UK). Indranil obtained his Bachelor of Technology (Computer Science) from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Chennai/Madras, in 1998.Indy is a world leader in inventing and implementing novel systems techniques that make distributed systems more reliable, predictable, and manageable. These include contributions and interests in both: a) core Distributed Systems topics, as well as b) Distributed Systems + X topics. Core distributed systems topics include batch processing, stream processing, and distributed storage---in all these areas his work has solved problems faced by open-source distributed systems used widely in industry. In the past he has worked on peer to peer systems, and nature-inspired distributed systems. Distributed Systems + X topics include collaborations and research results in Distributed Machine Learning, Distributed Systems + IoT, verification of Distributed Systems, and others. Prof. Gupta also collaborates with industry, contributing to their production systems as well as helping shine light on their production systems. His research results are in use by multiple prominent companies.  Prof. Gupta runs one of the most diverse groups in the CS department---about 50% of his PhD students are women.For more research information, papers, slides, and software see the website of Prof. Gupta's \"Distributed Protocols Research Group\" (DPRG): http://dprg.cs.uiuc.edu/ Prof. Indranil Gupta (Indy) is also a leader in democratizing the teaching of distributed systems. He teaches the world's largest (online) course on Distributed Systems. Offered via Coursera, his \"Cloud Computing Concepts\" courses (Parts 1 and 2) together have about 100k students annually, and are used by companies, startups, and taken by students of all generations, across 198 countries. In addition, Indy loves teaching in the classroom and handles classes of up to 500 students per semester, who are all excited to learn about distributed systems!Since you made it this far in the bio (or perhaps you jumped ahead strategically---either way, nice work!), you get a prize! Did you know that Indy has a Youtube channel where he improvises songs to teach Distributed Systems concepts and on topics related to CS Research? Check out one of his videos here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG2wmdkkeY0\n",

            "Mark Hasegawa-Johnson has been on the faculty at the University of Illinois since 1999, where he is currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  He received his Ph.D. in 1996 at MIT, with a thesis titled \"Formant and Burst Spectral Measures with Quantitative Error Models for Speech Sound Classification,\" after which he was a post-doc at UCLA from 1996-1999.  Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson is a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America (2011, for contributions to vocal tract and speech modeling) and a Fellow of the IEEE (2020, for contributions to speech processing of under-resourced languages).  He is currently Senior Area Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language, and a member of the  ISCA Diversity Committee.  He has published 308 peer-reviewed journal articles, patents and conference papers in the general area of automatic speech analysis, including machine learning models of articulatory and acoustic phonetics, prosody, dysarthria, non-speech acoustic events, audio source separation, and under-resourced languages.\n",
            "Teaching StatementProfessor Hasegawa-Johnson typically teaches Artificial Intelligence (CS 440/ECE 448), Multimedia Signal Processing (ECE 417), Speech Processing (ECE 537), and Speech and Image Analysis (ECE 401).  He has also taught Digital Signal Processing (ECE 551), Audio Engineering (ECE 403), Pattern Recognition (ECE 544NA), and Probability (ECE 313).\n",
            "Research StatementDr. Hasegawa-Johnson's research is focused on the area of automatic speech recognition, with a particular focus on the mathematization of linguistic concepts. In the past five years, Dr. Hasegawa-Johnson's group has developed mathematical models of concepts from linguistics including a rudimentary model of pre-conscious speech perception (the landmark-based speech recognizer), a model that interprets pronunciation variability by figuring out how the talker planned his or her speech movements (tracking of tract variables from acoustics, and of gestures from tract variables), and a model that uses the stress and rhythm of natural language (prosody) to disambiguate confusable sentences. Recent application successes include:* Speech recognition for talkers with cerebral palsy.  The automatic system, suitably constrained, outperforms a human listener.* Retrieval of broadcast television segments in four languages, based on queries specified in the international phonetic alphabet.  The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took third place in this international competition, and was the only finalist from the United States.* Automatic detection and labeling of non-speech audio events.  The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took first place in this international competition.* Teaching Chinese.  Software and methods developed by Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson, together with his colleagues from Linguistics and Psychology, are being tested in Mandarin language classrooms at the University of Illinois.\n",
            "Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesProfessor Hasegawa-Johnson typically supervises one or two undergraduate research projects per year, thesis research preferred.  Past student theses include automatic recognition of musical genre, factorial HMMs for the automatic recognition of speech in music backgrounds, prosody-dependent speech recognition, image source modeling of room impulse response, sonorancy classification for automatic language ID, phonetic landmark detection for automatic language ID, and digital field recorder for acquisition of a natural audio database.\n",

            "Kris Hauser is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research interests lie in robot planning and control, a field devoted to providing the decision-making capabilities needed for robots and other intelligent agents to perform complex physical tasks. His research builds upon the theoretical foundations of state space dynamics and optimality, but attempts to overcome the shortcomings of classical theory when faced the complexities of real-world systems, such as high dimensionality, uncertain dynamics, bounded computation, and integration with perception and learning. The methodologies at the foundation of this work include optimization, probabilistic methods, AI, control theory, and physics simulation, and theory is bridged with practice on real-world physical robots in the context of a diverse range of applications with social impact, including robot locomotion and manipulation, medical robots, human-operated robots, warehouse automation, and intelligent vehicles. Prof. Hauser received his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2008, bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from UC Berkeley in 2003, and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley. He then joined the faculty at Indiana University from 2009-2014, where he started the Intelligent Motion Lab, and then joined the faculty of Duke University from 2014-2019. Prof. Hauser is a recipient of a Stanford Graduate Fellowship, Siebel Scholar Fellowship, Best Paper Award at IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Robots 2015, the NSF CAREER award, and two Amazon Research Awards.

            "Teaching StatementStudents are humans.Students are not brains on sticks. When I first began teaching, I missed this. I focused so much on crafting perfect explanations and was dismayed when students didn’t learn well. I responded by studying cognitive psychology to understand why learning is difficult. This knowledge improved my teaching, but was also inadequate, addressing my students’ cognition but not the rest of their being. Students come to my courses with complex and varied motivations, experiences, and knowledge all contextualized by history, politics, and culture. I’ve since become a student of organizational psychology, sociology, counseling psychology, and history. I’m beginning to understand the systemic factors that give some students a head start and keep others shackled at the starting line. I’ve started to scratch the surface of how things like cultural narratives and social media can paralyze students with fears of inadequacy and drive them away from a field where they could thrive. I am cultivating what I hope is a holistic teaching philosophy that embraces the needs of all my students. I design sequences of activities that require students to put their knowledge and skills into action. Before coming to class in CS 233 Computer Architecture, students watch short video lectures and then complete a short, autograded assignment. Then in class, students solve problems on the same material in a group with their peers. These assignments require students to use their knowledge in many ways, explaining their reasoning to peers, answering autograded questions, and wrestling with reflection questions that ask them why a solution was sufficient or how concepts interact. These multi-modality activities are critical for helping students develop robust knowledge and the ability to use it flexibly. Students then engage the same material yet again after class through short homework assignments and longer lab assignments. I try to directly build on knowledge from one module to the next. If not possible, I assign short exercises late in the semester to remind students of content from earlier in the course. The possibility of success or failure, the immediate feedback, the minimal points, and the repeated exercises on the same content all help students’ bodies and minds experience the information as important and give them enough practice to begin automating their use of knowledge to achieve higher-level performance.I design my courses with my students’ mental and emotional health in mind. While some stress is needed to trigger deeper learning, too much stress makes learning impossible. Rather than having a few high-stakes exams, I use many lower stakes quizzes to minimize test anxiety. I also provide students with a second chance on quizzes for when they perform poorly. These techniques make stress more manageable and also reinforce active learning with spaced repetition in their learning. I also share about my own struggles with mental health and frequently remind students about the accommodations we provide. The use of frequent assessments and course rhythms helps me detect when students are struggling. For example, students who are struggling with their emotional health during my class frequently start by missing deadlines for the labs and then missing quizzes and then homework assignments. By monitoring when students miss multiple deadlines, I have been better able to reach out to students before they enter a freefall and get them the help and accommodations they need. I use collaborative learning for my in-class activities to fight these historic injustices. We require all students in CS 233 to rotate group members for the first couple weeks of the semester so that isolated students have a chance to network and build their social capital and find study partners. When we need to assign students to teams, we make sure that students from minoritized groups are not isolated on their teams but get to see other minoritized students in CS and normalize their own presence. I also focus on hiring students from underrepresented groups to my course staff to help student teams during class and further increase their visible representation in my classroom. Collaborative learning also provides a context where students feel that they are not alone in their struggles to learn but instead build connections with others through shared struggles. The use of collaborative learning also gives me the freedom to devote more of my attention and energy to students who are struggling. When helping teams during class, I normalize failure and struggle by always reinforcing that each team had a question or made a mistake that I had seen other teams have and that groups were not alone in their struggles. I essentially get to give 8 hours of individualized attention to students every week, even in a class of 400.I am committed to continuing to learn as a teacher and grow as a person so that I can better dignify and humanize my students, caring for their whole persons and not just their learning outcomes.\n",

            "Sheldon H. Jacobson is a Founder Professor of Computer Science, Director of the Simulation and Optimization Laboratory, and Founding Director of the Bed Time Research Institute at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  He holds appointments in Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, and the College of Medicine.  He has a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Mathematics from McGill University and a Ph.D. in Operations Research from Cornell University.  He has served on the faculties at Case Western Reserve University (Weatherhead School of Management, 1988-1993), Virginia Tech (Industrial and Systems Engineering, 1993-1999), and the University of Illinois (1999-present).  He has published 186 peer-reviewed articles, 11 book chapters, 50 conference proceedings, 45 professional and editorial publications, and delivered over 510 presentation, seminars and posters at conferences, universities, and research laboratories around the world.  He has directed 23 Ph.D. dissertations and been awarded over $5M of research support from the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.  As Director of the Bed Time Research Institute, he spearheaded the creation of two research videos (“A Healthy Collaboration: Pediatric Immunization and Operations Research”, “Aviation Security: Researching the Risk.”) and launched four websites, all designed to communicate the value of basic research through Broader Impact activities, and promulgate STEM activities for enhancing and growing a technically literate citizenry.  (http://bracketodds.cs.illinois.edu,  , http://electionanalytics.cs.illinois.edu, http://drivingobesity.cs.illinois.edu, http://redistricting.cs.illinois.edu).He has made several seminal research contributions, all focusing on applying operations research and optimization-based artificial intelligence to address societal problems of national interest.  He launched the research field, aviation security analytics, demonstrating how probabilistic models, optimization, and artificial intelligence can be used to improve the performance of aviation security systems.   His research on multi-level aviation security passenger screening at airports was the precursor to risk-based security, providing the foundational concepts that informed the design and implementation of TSA Precheck© (see the presentation he delivered on 3 October 2003 to the TSA outlining the benefits and foundations for differential passenger screening; see also the video).  His contributions have been recognized with numerous awards, including a 2003 Guggenheim Fellowship and the 2018 INFORMS Impact Prize, given biennially to recognize widespread impact of operations research.   His research on the design of pediatric vaccine formularies introduced the use of operations research in the pediatric immunization domain.  His research on bridging obesity, transportation, and fuel consumption established the impact of transportation on obesity, providing the foundation for non-medical obesity interventions based on modes of transportation.     His research on computational redistricting demonstrates how optimization-based AI can be used to combat gerrymandering by creating a transparent environment for designing and evaluating district maps. His research has been widely reported and communicated in the national press, including the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, and the Boston Globe, editorialized in the New York Times, and discussed in Business Week, Forbes, Kiplinger, and The Osgood Files on CBS radio.  He has appeared on The Street Signs (CNBC), The Closing Bell (CNBC), Weekends with Alex Witt (MSNBC), Washington Post Radio, CBS This Morning, CBC Canada News (television and radio), and BBC World News (television and radio).  His views have been published as opinion-editorials and letters in the Washington Post, Quartz, CNN Opinion, Inside Higher Ed, the Wall Street Journal, and the Chicago Tribune.He has been recognized with numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship (2003), the INFORMS Impact Prize (2018), the IISE David F. Baker Distinguished Research Award (2017), IISE Award for Technical Innovation in Industrial Engineering (2010, 2013), the Aviation Security Research Award (Aviation Security International) (2002), the IIE Outstanding Publication Award (2009), the Award for Excellence in the Teaching of Operations Research (IISE Operations Research Division) (2011), and runner-up for the Christopher Columbus Homeland Security Award (Transportation and Border Security) (2010).  He is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS, 2020), the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS, 2013) and the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE, 2011).  He has also received several best paper and poster awards, including the 2019 Best Service Science paper for his research on computational redistricting.His leadership and expertise have been used by both government and professional societies.  He briefed personnel within the Office of Science and Technology Policy (in the executive Office of President George W. Bush) (August 2002, Washington, DC) on issues related to aviation security and assessing the cost and benefit of checked baggage screening strategies.  He briefed the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) on a web-site he co-developed for designing optimal pediatric vaccine formularies (October 2001, Atlanta, Georgia.)  He served on committees for the National Academies, including the National Research Council Committee on Airport Passenger Screening: Backscatter X-Ray Machines (2013-2015), the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) Standing Committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Strategic National Stockpile (2015-2017), and A Workshop on Medical-Product Shortages: Effects on Patient Health and Opportunities to Predict, Prevent, and Respond to Them (2018).  He led the NSF-Funded workshop (May 2016, Arlington, VA), Setting a Broader Impacts Innovation Roadmap, in creating new pathways for enhancing Broader Impacts in the Engineering Directorate at the NSF. He served as the (elected) Treasurer for the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) (2015-2016) and as a Program Director in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation at the National Science Foundation (2012-2014).  He was an invited panelist at the 2019 INFORMS Government and Analytics Summit.\n",

            "I am the  W.J. ‘Jerry’ Sanders III – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Endowed Chair Professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and a fellow of both ACM and IEEE. From 2018 to 2020, I took a leave of absence and as a Sr. Vice President at a major memory manufacturing company I led the development of next-generation DRAM products , including the industry's first HBM-PIM that will play a significant role in shaping the future computing landscape. Prior to joining the University of Illinois in the fall of 2015, I was an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison where I was early-tenured in 2013. My interdisciplinary research incorporates device, circuit, architecture, and software for power-efficient computing. Prior to joining the University of Wisconsin, Madison, I was a senior research scientist at Intel from 2004 to 2008, where I conducted research in power-efficient digital circuit and process architecture. I have published more than 200 refereed articles to highly-selective conferences and journals in the field of digital circuit, processor architecture, and computer-aided design. The top three most frequently cited papers have more than 4500 citations and  the total number of citations of all my papers exceeds 12000. I was a recipient of the IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC) Student Design Contest Award in 2001, Intel Fellowship in 2002, the IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO) Best Paper Award in 2003, NSF CAREER Award in 2010, IBM Faculty Award in 2011 and 2012, the University of Wisconsin Villas Associates Award in 2015, ACM/IEEE Most Influential International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) Paper Award in 2017, and SIGMICRO 2021 Test of Time Awards in 2021. I am a hall of fame member of all three major computer architecture conferences, IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) , MICRO, and ISCA.

            "Alex Kirlik is Professor in the Department of Computer Science with additional appointments in the Department of Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, and the Information Trust Institute, the Coordinated Science Laboratory, the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory and the Illinois Informatics Institute. He previously served as acting head of Illinois's Human Factors program in the Institute of Aviation from 2006-2010.    Alex earned his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Industrial & Systems Engineering (Human-Machine Systems) at The Ohio State University. His Ph.D. thesis, \"The organization of perception and action in complex control skills\" earned the George Briggs Award from APA's Division of Applied Experimental and Engineering Psychologists, as the best dissertation of the year.  During his academic career, in addition to positions held with his home institutions at the University of Illinois (2002-date) and Georgia Tech (1989-2001), Alex has held visiting positions at Stanford University and NASA Ames Research Center (ASEE-NASA Stanford Summer Faculty Fellow, 1989, 1990), Yale University, Haskins Laboratory and the University of Connecticut (Visiting Scholar, 2001-02 academic year), Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, MA (Sabbatical Research, 2012-13 academic year), and the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety (Visiting Scholar, summer 2015).\n",
            "Alex's research interests include human-computer interaction, human factors,  visual analytics to support judgment and decision making, human-robot interaction, social computing, human-automation interaction and decision support is sociotechnical systems such as aviation, space, intelligence analysis, severe weather forecasting, disaster and emergency response, healthcare and medicine, autonomous vehicles, education and so forth.\n",
            "Teaching StatementAlex's approach to teaching and mentoring students is naturally dependent of the level of instruction involved. Perhaps one notable aspect of his educational approach is that no crisp line can be drawn between his interests and activities in research and teaching. For example, he has advised 3 PhD dissertations on the development and evaluation of new techniques and technologies for teaching engineering design.\n",
            "His research and educational activities also dovetail in the realm of his graduate seminars, which are intensively group- and project-based, typically involving students in actual research projects to motivate and animate the course material. For example, in 2010 Alex seized on an opportunity afforded by a U.S. “Challenge.gov” Health and Human Services competition that required competing project teams to design a Facebook app that would be useful to people in the aftermath of natural disasters and emergencies. This project not only involved the students, working as a design team, to create a conceptual design for the app, but to also create a working software prototype and a video demo. The competition was open to any group who wanted to enter – it was not specifically targeted to the educational community or to educational institutions. The students’ design earned  3rd place nationally: www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/02/20120223b.html\n",
            "Research StatementAlex Kirlik’s research program in human-computer interaction, human factors, and cognitive science & engineering has focused on understanding and supporting the cognition (judgment, decision making, prediction, problem solving and system control), of professionals working in technological workplaces, operational contexts and sociotechnical systems. His research contributing to commercial aviation safety in both airborne and ground operations has been supported by NASA for over 25 years.\n",
            "Recently, aspects of these lines of research have matured into NSF- and NASA-sponsored multidisciplinary projects, joint with collaborators in aerospace, mechanical and software engineering, to create and evaluate formal techniques and general principles for the design of safe and robust cyber-physical-human systems comprised of people and hardware and software automation: Engineering Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) Systems. The aim of this research, which is relevant to applications not solely in aviation but in contexts such as healthcare and highways, is to achieve levels of human-automation system performance, robustness and safety exceeding what would be achievable by either a human or automation acting alone. A 5-minute public video demo illustrating this work in an aviation context is available at: www.youtube.com/watch. \n",
            "A second major thrust of Alex's research concerns support for judgment and decision making in high-stakes tasks. This line of research developed into an NSF-sponsored project to develop and evaluate quantitative models of judgment in technological systems (e.g., KIrlik, 2006, Adaptive Perspectives on Human-Technology Interaction, NY: Oxford; see: www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780195171822/).\n",
            ". Recently, he and his multi-disciplinary team began a 3-year research project involving the design and use of domestic, aerial and ground robotics to support aging-in-place called ASPIRE: Automation Supporting Prolonged Independent Residence for the Elderly, sponsored by the National Robotics Initiative.  A brief video showing progress to date, presented at the October, 2016 \"Aging 2.0\" conference in San Francisco can be viewed at: \n",
            "Also, Alex has co-edited (with J.D. Lee) the first authoritative handbook of its kind, The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Engineering, representing the contributions of more than 60 of the discipline’s most influential and accomplished researchers: \n",

            "I joyfully joined the Illinois Department of Computer Science after years of research in Biomedical informatics all in the Boston Longwood Medical area including Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals.There are two things that I feel very important in my career, one is I think learning is a life long journey, the other is there are always surprises and we must embrace changes. For example when I received my B. E. in Precision Machinery and Instrumentation from the Univ. of Science and Technology of China  I didn’t expect at all I would get my PhD from MIT in the area of computer aided design for 3-D Printing— because there was not even AutoCAD in my college years.After my doctoral studies, I was drawn to the area of Biomedical research due to both my interest in helping cure diseases and my new found faith. In the years I spent in Boston Longwood Area, I have done research in diverse Data Science related areas such as Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Biostatistics, and Machine learning.Over a 4-year period of encountering/interacting with students, reviewing academic works and college teaching, I discovered I feel happiest when I work with undergraduate students and I enjoy teaching undergraduate students and training next generation of computer scientists and data-centered professionals. I am passionate about mentoring undergraduate students and helping undergraduate students do research. My research is focused on understanding the needs of students with disabilities and broadening the participation of students with disabilities. I am currently PI of two projects at the Univ. of Illinois on helping students with disabilities and PI of a project on exploring UDL in teaching STEM courses. The projects are: SIIP project \"UDL based best practices including utilizing Canvas for the needs of students with disability\"; GIANT project \"Applying a Theoretical Understanding of Text-Based Learning Modalities To Develop New Course Modalities That Meet the Needs of Student With Disabilities\".Other interests include Biomedical applications that involve large high dimensional data analysis and machine learning and data-driven educational improvement for undergraduate students.\n",

It looks at the fundamental solution concepts from economics, game theory, and social choice from the computational lens. I am also interested in understanding questions related to fairness in society, and evolution in nature.My main research interests lie in the areas of algorithmic game theory, mathematical economics, and in design of efficient algorithms. I am interested in exploring the computability of equilibria, both market and Nash, under various settings, and also understanding the impact of strategic behavior in multi-agent situations. Currently, I am exploring problems from dynamic matching, fair division of scarce resources, and market design for cloud computing. In addition I am exploring avenues for interdisciplinary applications of these tools to genetic evolution, machine learning and dynamical systems.\n",

            "David Padua has served as program committee member, program chair, or general chair to more than 70 conferences and workshops. He was the Editor-in-Chief of Springer‐Verlag’s Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing and is currently a member of the editorial board of the Communications of the ACM, the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, and the International Journal of Parallel Programming. He has devoted much of his career to the study of languages, tools, and compilers for parallel computing. His PhD dissertation was one of the first studies on compiler techniques for multiprocessors. He has continued this work contributing with techniques for program analysis and program transformation as well as methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of compilers. He pioneered the study of race detection techniques for shared-memory program. Padua has worked on autotuning, high level notations for parallel programming, compiler evaluation, and the efficient implementation of scripting languages. In the area of autotuning, he has worked on the development of compiler strategies, advanced notations, accurate performance models, and machine learning‐based search techniques. He led the development of the hierarchically tiled arrays notation whose goal is to facilitate the representation of parallelism and locality. His research group collaborated with IBM compiler writers in an influential evaluation of the effectiveness of vectorization. In the area of scripting languages, his research group developed techniques to improve the performance of MATLAB and R programs. Padua has supervised the dissertations of 30 PhD students. He has published more than 170 papers in programming languages, compilers, tools and parallel machine design. He received the 2015 IEEE Computer Society Harry H. Goode Award. In 2017, he awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Valladolid in Spain. He is a Fellow of the ACM. the IEEE and the AAAS.\n",

            "Research Statement1. Computational Molecular and Systems BiologyProtein structure, interaction, and function are by nature intertwined, with structure, or structural properties, playing a large role in defining the function and understanding human diseases. As such, determining protein structure has been one of the most important challenges in biology. In parallel, given the many obstacles to experimental structure determination, computational prediction of protein structure remains one of the longest-standing challenges in computational biology. My group has developed a number of machine learning algorithms to tackle this problem. In particular, DeepContact, an approach that employs deep learning for protein contact prediction, has achieved substantial improvement over previous approaches, highlighted by its performance (as a co-winner) in the most recent Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP12) in 2016. In another recent work, we developed DeepSignal, a recurrent neural network model to study protein function, such as phosphorylation and motif binding. Applied to the cellular signaling system, DeepSignal not only improves the prediction but also enable mutational analysis for studying the functional variants in human diseases, such as cancer. We have then extended the model for other types of protein-substrate interactions, including protein-RNA binding and protein-peptide binding. Most recently, we developed a deep-learning model to integrate evolutionary representations for efficient protein design and engineering.Moving from individual molecules, a systematic understanding of their interactions and functions, from heterogeneous datasets, is critical for both biological and translational medicine research. I have been developing efficient machine learning algorithms, especially integrative manifold learning algorithms, to extract information from various interactomic datasets. My algorithm, Mashup, takes full advantage of network-specific topology by learning a canonical representation that best integrates the topological patterns across multiple biological networks. Its substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art methods in distinct functional inference tasks demonstrate its applicability to effectively deciphering functional properties of genes from interactomes. Based on Mashup, my group has developed generalized versions to incorporate other data types, including text, homology, and structures2. Pharmacogenomics and Human Disease GenomicsComputational prediction of drug–target interactions (DTIs) has become an important step in the drug discovery or repositioning process, aiming to identify putative new drugs or novel targets for existing drugs to accelerate drug discovery. Collaborating with biologists, my group has developed DTINet based on Mashup that integrates diverse drug information for DTI prediction. Validated on benchmarks and by experiments, DTINet offers a practical and accurate tool to predict unknown DTIs, which may provide new insights into drug discovery or repositioning. Furthermore, I have been working with doctors and medical researchers, applying my algorithms to studying human diseases. In a recent Cell Systems article, we systematically mapped molecular pathways underlying the toxicity of alpha-synuclein, a protein central to Parkinson’s disease. To translate findings from yeast screens, we developed a computational method to integrates a Steiner prize-collecting approach with homology assignment through Mashup integration with sequence, structure, and interaction topology. This work has been featured as the cover article in the issue and received multiple highlights in media and a Bishop Dr. Karl Golser Paper Award. Based on the network, we have performed a high-depth exome-capture of these genes in 500 patients with synucleinopathy and identified novel rare variants that are enriched in carriers of mutations in LRRK2 and GBA.  Collaborating with researchers from UCSD School of Medicine, we have identified a novel way to stratify cancer patients by their tumor mutations using networks.3. Data Analytics and Machine Learning In addition to bioinformatics problems, we have been working on developing new machine learning algorithms for data analysis and deep reinforcement learning algorithms for process optimization of scientific experiments. Collaborating with chemists, we have been developing a fully automated molecular synthesis system powered by deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms. \n",

As animals age and pass through different life stages, their genetically determined behavioral responses to environmental and social stimuli change in predictable ways. Often these responses increase in complexity and involve learning. Our research is designed to explain the function and evolution of behavioral mechanisms that integrate the activity of individuals in a society, neural and neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate behavior within the brain of the individual, and the genes that influence social behavior.\n",

            "Grigore Rosu does research in design, semantics and implementation of programming and specification languages, automated software engineering and formal methods, especially push-button techniques for certification, monitoring, synthesis and modularization, and in automated reasoning about computer systems, applications of logics, theorem proving, algorithms, (co)algebra, and category theory.  He teaches classes on software engineering, programming languages, formal methods, and runtime verification.  Before joining UIUC in 2002, he was a research scientist at NASA Ames.  He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of California at San Diego in 2000 and his M.S. at the University of Bucharest, Romania, in 1996.   Grigore was offered the CAREER award by the NSF in 2005, the outstanding junior award by the CS Department at UIUC in 2005, and the Dean's award for excellence in research by the College of Engineering at UIUC in 2014.  He won the ASE IEEE/ACM most influential paper award in 2016 and the RV test of time award for papers published in 2001 that shaped the runtime verification field, and distinguished/best paper awards at ASE 2008, ASE 2016, OOPSLA 2016, ETAPS 2002.  He was ranked a UIUC excellent teacher in Spring 2013, Fall 2012, Spring 2008 and Fall 2004.Rosu is known for work in runtime verification, the K framework, matching logic, and automated coinduction.Runtime verification was coined by Havelund and Rosu as the name of a workshop they started in 2001, aimed at addressing problems at the boundary between formal verification and testing.  Since 2001,   runtime verification  (RV) has grown into an active and diverse community, with its own international conference.  The underlying idea of RV is to verify a system while it executes, where the system is either instrumented or simulated in an environment in which efficient monitors are generated from specifications and checked against the running system.  Combined with recovery when properties are violated, RV can be used as a scalable alternative to formal verification, yielding the same correctness guarantees but at a cost fraction.  Runtime verification has got significant traction in the formal verification and software engineering communities, where major conferences include special tracks named Runtime Verification.  Within the RV field, Rosu and his collaborators introduced several notions, seminal algorithms and techniques for parametric property monitoring, efficient monitor synthesis, runtime predictive analysis, as well as monitoring-oriented programming as a programming paradigm where a formal specification and an implementation form together a (runtime verified) system.  In 2010, Rosu founded the company Runtime Verification, Inc. , as a vehicle to productize and commercialize RV technology to customers such as NASA, Boeing, Toyota, Denso, as well as emerging companies in the blockchain space such as Ethereum Foundation, IOHK, Tezos, Algorand, Maker, Gnosis, etc.The  K framework  was proposed by Rosu together with his FSL lab in 2003, as an executable semantic framework.  Programming languages, type systems and formal analysis tools can be defined uniformly in the K framework, using configurations, computations and rewrite rules.  The distinctive feature of K is that once a system is formalized as a K definition, all the tools needed for that system, from concrete execution engines (interpreters, virtual machines (VMs), compilers) to symbolic execution and formal verification tools, can and should be derived automatically or semi-automatically, correct-by-construction.  The goal of K is to put an end to the adhoc language tool development.  Several complete semantics of real-life programming languages, such as C, Java, JavaScript, Python, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine, have been formally defined in K.Matching logic is a unifying logic for programming languages, specification, and verification.   Matching logic is as expressive as first-order logic (FOL) plus induction, but it provides a compact notation that captures, as syntactic sugar, several logics and formalisms of critical importance such as: algebraic specification and initial algebra semantics, FOL with least fixed points , typed or untyped lambda-calculi, dependent type systems, separation logic with recursive predicates, rewriting logic, Hoare logic, temporal logics, dynamic logic, modal μ-calculus, and so on.Rosu proposed circular coinduction in his PhD thesis, as an automation of coinduction in the context of hidden logic.  This was further generalized into a principle that unifies and automates proofs by both induction and coinduction, and has been implemented or incorporated in provers such as Coq, Isabelle/HOL, and CIRC.\n",

            "Lui Sha graduated with Ph.D. from CMU in 1985. He worked at the Software Engineering Institute from 1986 to1998. He joined UIUC in 1998 as a full professor. Currently, he is Donald B. Gillies Chair Professor of Computer Science Department and Daniel C. Drucker Eminent Faculty at UIUC's College of Engineering.  He is a fellow of IEEE and ACM, and a recipient of the IEEE Simon Ramo Medal for exceptional achievement in systems engineering and systems science. He was a member of National Academic of Science's Committee on Certifiably Dependable Software Systems and a member of NASA Advisory Council. He led the research, development, and the transition to practice on real-time and embedded computing technologies, which were cited as a major accomplishment in the selected accomplishment section of the 1992 National Academy of Science's report, \"A Broader Agenda for Computer Science and Engineering\" (P.193). He led a comprehensive revision of IEEE standards on real-time computing, which have since become the best practice in real-time computing systems. Now it has been widely used in real-time systems such as airplanes, robots, cars, ships, trains, medical devices. His work on real-time and safety-critical system integration has impacted many high technology programs, including GPS, Space Station, and Mars Pathfinder. In recent years, his team has been working on autonomous vehicles.His recent research includes: 1) Physics Model Edited DNN.  A physics model is a validated low-dimensional model of causality with critical properties such as provable stability. DNN is a high-dimensional model of correlations that may capture not only unmodeled dynamics in physics model but also  spurious corrections in the training samples (overfitting) that leads to outputs inconsistent with physical laws.  Physics Edited DNN combines the best of the physical model and DNN model; 2) Medical GPS systems to dramatically reduce preventable medical errors, which are the misapplication of complex modern medical knowledge. Preventable medical errors claim 250,000 lives per year and are the third leading cause of deaths in the USA alone.\n",

            "Research StatementParis Smaragdis is best known for contributions in the field of audio processing, more specifically on the problem of source separation (the process of extracting an isolated signal from a mixture). His work on Frequency Domain Independent Component Analysis resulted in the first practical real-time implementations of such systems in the 90s. His later work on Non-Negative Spectral Factorizations was widely adopted for many audio applications, and more recently his introduction of end-to-end deep learning methods for source separation and denoising has resulted in wide adoption.Smaragdis’ current research focus is on very efficient on-device processing of audio using deep learning, as well as methods for distributed learning over thousands of sensors. He is currently investigating the use of graph models for parameter-free representations of time sequences, binary network signal processing systems, online on-device learning, and is also interested in fully-differentiable digital signal processing systems.\n",

            "Sundaram received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Columbia University (2002) under Shih-Fu Chang's supervision. After his Ph.D., he was recruited by Arizona State University to help co-found (along with Thanassis Rikakis) the School of Arts, Media and Engineering (AME). AME is a transdisciplinary school that emphasizes scholarship and pedagogy with roots in the arts, design, and engineering. He served as Associate Director for AME (2009-12). He joined the University of Illinois in 2014 as an Associate Professor with a joint appointment between the departments of Computer Science and the Charles H. Sandage Department of Advertising. He received the Eliahu Jury award for best dissertation (2002), IBM faculty awards (2007, 2008), and several best-paper awards and best-paper runner-up honors from IEEE and ACM conferences. He was elected as ACM distinguished scientist in 2019 and IEEE senior member in 2019. \n",
            "Sundaram's research spans applied machine learning, network science, and human-computer interaction. He develops algorithms and builds systems that help individuals to understand and to act. Constraining system and algorithm design to account for human cognition limits is a central thread in his research. Among his major contributions in Multimedia Computing include a feedback-control algorithm for a ground-breaking, real-time mixed-reality system for stroke patient rehabilitation, which aimed to help stroke survivors re-learn how to reach and grasp objects. Other major contributions within Network Science include algorithms for identifying homogenous communities within large heterogeneous networks, detecting collective behavior, and efficient sampling of large graphs.\n",
            "Sundaram’s current focus is motivated by the need to solve large-scale collective-action problems (e.g., public health; climate change). Collective-action problems require us to confront a fundamental tension:  How do we reconcile an individual’s desire for agency and choice in what they do with the greater common good? Computer Science can facilitate a scaling effect on theories of collective action. He develops algorithms for robust inference of behavior, including systemic bias, designs mechanisms to improve social-welfare, designs algorithms for synthesis of messages, and develops computational infrastructure to enable large-scale field experiments.\n",

            "Gang Wang received his Ph.D. from UC Santa Barbara in 2016 (under the direction of Ben Y. Zhao and Heather Zheng), and a B.E. from Tsinghua University in 2010. After working as an Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech (2016 - 2019), he joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019. Currently, he is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and also has affiliate faculty appointments in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and the Informatics Program of the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2018), Amazon Research Award (2021), Google Faculty Research Award (2017), and Best Paper Awards from IMWUT 2019, ACM CCS 2018, and SIGMETRICS 2013. His projects have been covered by media outlets such as MIT Technology Review, The New York Times, Boston Globe, CNN, and ACM TechNews.            Gang Wang's research interests are Security and Privacy, Internet Measurement, and Data Mining. His work takes a data-driven approach to addressing emerging security threats in massive communication systems (social media, email services), crowdsourcing systems, mobile applications, and enterprise networks. His major contribution is a series of measurement methodologies that have revealed previously overlooked security threats, including crowdturfing activities in online social networks, security certification failures in the payment card industry, email spoofing vulnerabilities in major email providers, and the deep link usage in mobile app ecosystems. Another key contribution is his work on applying machine learning in security applications (e.g., bot detection, malware classification) to handle adversarial behaviors and concept drift. Gang Wang's current focus is on developing robust data-driven methods (e.g., machine learning models, graph models) to enable accurate, scalable, and user-friendly security applications for malware analysis and online abuse mitigation. The key challenge Wang is tackling is to effectively engineer human-machine collaboration pipelines to improve the efficacy and efficiency of both parties against adaptive attackers in the respective fields. Wang is currently collaborating with industry partners and researchers from related fields such as HCI and AI to address these problems.  \n",

            "Professional development: Warnow received her PhD in Mathematics at UC Berkeley (1991) under the direction of Gene Lawler, and did postdoctoral training with Simon Tavare and Michael Waterman at the University of Southern California (1991-1992). After positions at Sandia National Laboratories (1992-1993), University of Pennsylvania (1993-1998), and the University of Texas (1998-2014), she joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a Founder Professor of Engineering. She is now Associate Head for Computer Science, and has affiliate faculty appointments in Bioengineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, and several biology departments.\n",
            "Awards: She received the National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award in 1994, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation Award in Science and Engineering in 1996, a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship in 2006, and a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship for 2011. She was elected a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 2015 and of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) in 2017.\n",
            "Teaching: At the undergraduate level, Warnow teaches courses in discrete mathematics and algorithm design and analysis, and use problems from computational biology to demonstrate the applications of these skills and techniques to real world problems. At the graduate level, Warnow teaches CS 581: Algorithmic Computational Genomics. The main focus of CS 581 is on phylogeny (evolutionary tree) estimation, but the course also covers the related problems of computing multiple sequence alignments, genome assembly, and analyzing microbiomes. Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations in these areas, read the current literature, and do a team research project. The techniques involved include discrete algorithms, graph theory, simulations, and probabilistic analysis of algorithms. Course website: http://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/581-2018.html.\n",
            "Leadership roles: Warnow has had several leadership roles in international consortia, including Genome 10K, the Avian Phylogenomics Project and the Thousand Plant Transcriptome Initiative. She was also the Director of the CIPRES (Cyber-Infrastructure for Phylogenetics Research) project (funded by a large ITR grant from NSF), which had more than 10 universities around the country, trained more than 50 PhD students (including many of the computer scientists now working in computational biology), and led to the establishment of the CIPRES Gateway. She also chaired the NIH study section for Biodata Management and Analysis (BDMA), and was the main program officer at NSF for the BIg Data solicitation.\n",
            "Research contributions:  Warnow's main research is in algorithms for statistical estimation problems in computational biology and historical linguistics. Among her major contributions are advances in mathematical foundations in phylogenetics and methods for multiple sequence alignment, for species tree estimation from multi-gene datasets, and for metagenomic taxon identification. Warnow's collaboration with linguist Don Ringe (Univ of Pennsylvania) led to a rigorous approach to inferring evolutionary histories (both trees and networks) for natural languages, and settled several outstanding conjectures for Indo-European.\n",

            "Research StatementProfessor Wooldridge's research addresses the design of complex sociotechnical systems, primarily in healthcare settings, using mixed methods approaches to improve outcomes. In healthcare, that means patient outcomes (e.g., patient safety, quality of care) as well as clinician outcomes (e.g., workload, burnout). She has conducted research focused on primary care, care coordination of patients with chronic conditions (hospital to community care transitions) and trauma care. Her dissertation, conducted in the context of a larger project developing health information technology to support teamwork and care transitions, took a macroergonomic approach to studying care transitions of trauma patients. She then examined on the handoff communication associated with those handoffs as instances of team cognition. Current projects include continuing to study care transitions; she plans to conduct observation studies of inpatient care transitions between hospital units as well as return to the community care setting by studying hospital discharge care transitions. Part of this work will explore the concept of the “patient journey,” i.e., spatio-temporal distribution of patients’ interactions with multiple care settings (e.g., hospitals, clinics, home, long-term care, etc.) over time. She plans to develop interventions, such as redesigned processes, new technologies, etc., to improve care transitions; this will involve participatory design processes and usability evaluations in her lab and/or simulated settings such as JUMP Simulation. A third area of research includes developing ways to measure team cognition, particular in care transitions. Key components of her research approach include engaging frontline workers (patients and their family as well as various healthcare professionals) and utilizing mixed methods, i.e., both qualitative and quantitative, research designs.Check out the Human Factors in Sociotechnical Systems Laboratory, directed by Dr. Wooldridge, website at https://hfss.ise.illinois.edu/contact-us/\n",

            "Craig Zilles is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His current research focuses on applying computing and data analytics to education, including the development of the Computer-based Testing Facility (CBTF). Historically, his research has focused on the interaction between compilers and computer architecture, especially in the context of managed and dynamic languages. He received his Ph.D. in 2002 from Wisconsin-Madison for his work with Guri Sohi on Speculative Slices and Master/Slave Speculative Parallelization. Prior to his work on computer architecture and compilers, he developed the first algorithm that allowed rendering arbitrary three-dimensional polygonal shapes for haptic interfaces (force-feedback human-computer interfaces).  He has been widely recognized for excellent teaching at the undergraduate level; he has received the campus  Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2018, the IEEE Education Society's 2010 Mac Van Valkenburg Early Career Teaching Award, the College of Engineering's Rose Award and Everitt Award for Teaching Excellence, and Illinois Student Senate Teaching Excellence Award.   He holds 5 patents, is a recipient of an NSF CAREER award, and his research has been recognized by best paper awards from ASPLOS in 2010 and 2013 and by selection for inclusion in the IEEE Micro Top Picks from the 2008 Computer Architecture Conferences.  \n",
